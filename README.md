# Europe R User Group Network (ERUN)
The proposal is to create a joint calendar and marketing project that adopts the template of the X-Europe Webinars series.


#### X-Europe Webinars
X-Europe Webinars (https://xeurope.carrd.co/) is an organization for joint online events of Vienna Data Science Group, 
Frankfurt Data Science, Budapest Data Science Meetup, BCN Analytics, Budapest.AI, Barcelona Data Science and Machine Learning Meetup, 
Budapest Deep Learning Reading Seminar and Warsaw R Users Group.

#### Geographic Scope
* Previously the scope was specific to European RUGs, but the scope can (and should) be expanded to include any RUG in EMEA (Europe Middle East and Africa).

#### Functional Scope
The project structure could be kept minimal - limited to the co-ordinating marketing and scheduling of each event.
The production of individual events would be the responsibility of each member RUG.
* Collaboration between RUGs in terms of recruiting speakers would be welcomed.

#### Codes of Conduct
All RUGs should have a Code of Conduction, and a way to mitigate proper compliance.

#### Sponsorship
There will be no common Sponsorship. Each RUG is free to manage their own sponsor relations, and display their own sponsors in their own events.
(The Why R? Foundation will be considered as a single RUG this project.)

#### Timetable Clashs
* It will not always be possible to prevent schedule clashes.
* Clashs can be mitigated by an expansive curational policy - such that scheduling events that have different topics.
